# 🏛️ GitHub Community & Configuration

This repository (`DuyetBKU/.github`) contains **reusable community health files** and **configuration templates** that apply globally to all repositories under [@DuyetBKU](https://github.com/DuyetBKU).

These include:

- ✅ **Issue and Pull Request templates**
- ✅ **Contributing guidelines**
- ✅ **Code of Conduct**
- ✅ **Security policy**
- ✅ **Default GitHub Actions workflows**
- ✅ **Other shared configuration files**

> By centralizing these files here, I ensure consistency, maintainability, and a better experience for contributors across all my public repositories.
